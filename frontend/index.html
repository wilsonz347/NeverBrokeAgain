    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div id="about-content">
        <p>
          Our project promotes financial inclusion by addressing a critical challenge international students face in the U.S.: navigating the student loan process.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Estimate the loan amount they need.</li>
          <li>Manage their repayment plans effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To solve this, we are developing an innovative app that helps international students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculate the optimal loan amount.</li>
          <li>Create a clear, manageable repayment schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app simplifies financial planning by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guiding students through estimating their expenses, including tuition, living costs, and other variables.</li>
          <li>Generating personalized loan repayment schedules.</li>
          <li>Empowering students to make informed financial decisions that align with their specific needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the U.S. financial system, student loans play a crucial role in enabling access to education, but navigating different loan types, interest rates, and repayment options can be overwhelming, especially for international students. Our app bridges this gap by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offering an easy-to-use tool that simplifies the complexities of student loans.</li>
          <li>Helping students plan their finances with confidence.</li>
          <li>Reducing the financial stress associated with higher education.</li>
        </ul>
