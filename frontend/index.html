    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div id="about-content">
        Our project promotes financial inclusion by addressing a critical challenge international students face in the U.S.: navigating the student loan process.
Many international students struggle to:
•	Estimate the loan amount they need.
•	Manage their repayment plans effectively.
To solve this, we are developing an innovative app that helps international students:
•	Calculate the optimal loan amount.
•	Create a clear, manageable repayment schedule.
The app simplifies financial planning by:
•	Guiding students through estimating their expenses, including tuition, living costs, and other variables.
•	Generating personalized loan repayment schedules.
•	Empowering students to make informed financial decisions that align with their specific needs.
In the U.S. financial system, student loans play a crucial role in enabling access to education, but navigating different loan types, interest rates, and repayment options can be overwhelming, especially for international students. Our app bridges this gap by:
•	Offering an easy-to-use tool that simplifies the complexities of student loans.
•	Helping students plan their finances with confidence.
•	Reducing the financial stress associated with higher education.
